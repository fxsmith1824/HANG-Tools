# HANG-Tools
 Selection of code written for the Human Auditory Neuroscience Group at the University of Iowa.
 
 This is currently an assortment of Python scripts that accomplish tasks for the lab.
 
 Current scripts:
 - file_verification.py: This is a simple GUI for comparing files (.bdf and .mat) on the local hard drive to the RDSS shared drive. This was written to help ensure that all necessary files are moved to the shared drive for later analysis. Eventually will include a function to move redundant files (those already on the lab server) to a specific folder for easy deletion from the local drive to save sapce.
